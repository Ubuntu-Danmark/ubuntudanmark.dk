== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) keys? =

You should go to the Settings page and click the 'here' link. Then you should enter your domain name in text field and click 'Create Key' button.
On the next screen you will see your public and private keys.

= How to hide Google Capthca for registered users? =

You should go to the Settings page and select the roles, for which you want to hide Google Captcha.
Then you must click 'Save Changes' button.

= How to chage Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) style? =

You should go to the Settings page and select Theme from dropdown list.
Then you must click the 'Save Changes' button.

= Missing Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) on the comment form? = 

You might have a theme where comments.php is not coded properly. 

Wopdpress version matters. 

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. 
Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the code line `do_action('comment_form'`... inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` (please check the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= How can I change the location of Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) in the comments form? =

It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works ('after_comment_field' or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call. Please find the file 'comments.php' in the theme and change position of the line

`do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );`

or any similar line - place it under the Submit button.

In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

= I would like to add Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

`if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); } ;`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'gglcptch_display' ) ) { echo gglcptch_display(); } ; ?>`
